### 📋 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰:

I recently completed a breast cancer classification project using various machine learning algorithms. The goal was to classify tumor types as benign or malignant, based on features derived from cell nuclei. This involved data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving models for future use. I explored multiple algorithms to enhance classification accuracy and reliability.
